# H1 inline-style-formatter

- Inline Style formatter

- Makes use of Typescript, webpack and jest

- JS inline styles are becoming more and more popular.  Why not take advantage of JS and have some 
interfaces we can call which will perform manuiplations to the style set as needed.

- This tool performs pixel addition, pixel multiplication, screen orientation calculations and much more!

- This widget will be published as an npm module.

TODO : Make everything type safe (why use ts in first place if not? - because i rewrote this on an airplane on notepad for fun and liked the implementation).
